We need to save it because memory is volatile and its contents would be lost once program terminated, so if we need some data again there are two ways one is retype via keyboard to assign it to particular variable, and other is regenerate it via programmatically both options are tedious. At such time it becomes necessary to store the data in a manner that can be later retrieved and displayed either in part or in whole. This medium is usually a ''file'' on the disk.\n" +
